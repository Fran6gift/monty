The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Monty byte code files

Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument:

julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ cat -e bytecodes/000.m
push 0$
push 1$
push 2$
  push 3$
                   pall    $
push 4$
    push 5    $
      push    6        $
pall$
julien@ubuntu:~/monty$
Monty byte code files can contain blank lines (empty or made of spaces only, and any additional text after the opcode or its required argument is not taken into account:

julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ cat -e bytecodes/001.m
push 0 Push 0 onto the stack$
push 1 Push 1 onto the stack$
$
push 2$
  push 3$
                   pall    $
$
$
                           $
push 4$
$
    push 5    $
      push    6        $
$
pall This is the end of our program. Monty is awesome!$

The monty program

Usage: monty file
where file is the path to the file containing Monty byte code
If the user does not give any file or more than one argument to your program, print the error message USAGE: monty file, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
If, for any reason, it‚Äôs not possible to open the file, print the error message Error: Can't open file <file>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
where <file> is the name of the file
If the file contains an invalid instruction, print the error message L<line_number>: unknown instruction <opcode>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
where is the line number where the instruction appears.
Line numbers always start at 1
The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stop if either:
it executed properly every line of the file
it finds an error in the file
an error occured
If you can‚Äôt malloc anymore, print the error message Error: malloc failed, followed by a new line, and exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.
You have to use malloc and free and are not allowed to use any other function from man malloc (realloc, calloc, ‚Ä¶)


Ubuntu 14.04 LTS - Operating system reqd.

üîß Monty Opcodes
push

Usage: push <int>
Pushes an element to the stack.
The parameter <int> must be an integer.
pall

Prints all values in the stack/queue, starting from the top.
pint

Prints the top value of the stack/queue.
pop

Removes the top element of the stack/queue.
swap

Swaps the top two elements of the stack/queue.
nop

Does not do anything.
add

Adds the top two elements of the stack/queue.
The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is popped.
sub

Subtracts the top element of the stack/queue from the second element from the top.
The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.
mul

Multiplies the top two elements of the stack/queue.
The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.
div

Divides the second element from the top of the stack/queue by the top element.
The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.
mod

Computes the modulus of the second element from the top of the stack/queue divided by the top element.
The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.
pchar

Prints the character value of the top element of the stack/queue.
The integer at the top is treated as an ASCII value.
pstr

Prints the string contained in the stack/queue.
Prints characters element by element until the stack/queue is empty, a value is 0, or an error occurs.
rotl

Rotates the top element of the stack/queue to the bottom.
rotr

Rotates the bottom element of the stack/queue to the top.
stack

Switches a queue to stack mode.
queue

Switches a stack to queue mode.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Opcodes preceeded by a # are treated as comments and the corresponding line is ignored.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Lines can be empty and can contain any number of spaces before or after an opcode and its argument (only the first opcode and/or argument is taken into account).

üìã Examples
Note, Monty Interpreter runs in the default mode of STACK mode. Meaning it uses a stack. To switch to queue mode, see examples below.

Push values onto the stack and print them all, or the top of the stack/front of queue.

$ cat push_pall_pint.m
push 1
push 2
push 3
pall
pint
$ ./monty push_pall_pint.m
3
2
1
3
Using mathmatical operations to add, multiply, divide, etc. Takes the second from the top and performs the operation on the top: second_from_top / top, second_from_top - top, etc. Then assigns that to the second_from_top and pops the top element off the stack.

$ cat math.m
push 3
push 2
push 1
pall
mul
pall
$ ./monty math.m
1
2
3
1
6
Entering queue mode to perform all operations in FIFO (queue) mode instead of default LIFO (stack) mode. Note: does not change current stack, sets front of queue to top of stack.

$ cat queue.m
queue
push 1
push 2
push 3
pall
stack
push 4
push 5
push 6
pall
$ ./monty queue.m
